# film-idea
Takes two random films from IMDB top ranked list (minus some films I thought might lead to offensive results and ones I didn't think people would know) and creates a "x meets y" sentence. Originally intended to actually be helpful but the results were too funny to take seriously most of the time.

## Future
I am apprehensive to put live as I am not sure what the licensing of film posters allows.
I plan to make it possible for the user to add extra films (would probably lose the poster anyway in this case) so it becomes a "x meets y meets z".
I could also add functionality to keep one of the films and only shuffle one at a time.
